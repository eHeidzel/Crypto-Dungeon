The number of letters in the real cipher of|3000
the original and encrypted messages|2000
are the same.|1000
However, in our implementation there are more|3500
This convention is necessary because|3000
in the conditions of|1500
the mini-game it is deciphered|2000
just one word|1500
Also, to encrypt in this cipher|2500
you need something similar to offset(radius)|3000
