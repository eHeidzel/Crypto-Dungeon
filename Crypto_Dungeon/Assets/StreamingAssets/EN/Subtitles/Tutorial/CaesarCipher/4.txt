For example,|1500
letâ€™s encrypt the word hello|2500
with offset 1|1500
write out the letters one by one|3000
and add them to their numbers|3000
selected offset|1500
Thus we get encrypted|2000
message letters|1500
All you have to do is write them in a line|3000
and you will get|1000
final encrypted message|1500
