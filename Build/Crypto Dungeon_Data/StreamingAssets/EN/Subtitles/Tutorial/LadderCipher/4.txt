it is important to know that|2500
instead of writing on a piece of paper you can|2500
just divide the letters into odd ones (1, 3, 5)|3500
and even(2, 4, 6)|2000
It is enough just to read the odd ones first,|3500
and then even|1500
And you get the same message|2500
as when recording with a ladder|2000
