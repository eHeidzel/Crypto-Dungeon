However, this often happens,|2000
that the message is longer than the key|2000
In this case, the key must be repeated,|3000
until its length moans the same|3000
as message length|1500
For example:|2000
Hello is not enough for a message|3000
boba key,|2000
since it has 4 letters,|2000
but you need to encode 5|2000
So that the length matches we|3000
start repeating the key|2000
boba(4) + b(1) = bobab(5 letters)|2000
Another example|2000
The word cryptography (12 letters) - message|2000
boba(4) - key|2000
boba(4) + bobaboba(8) = bobabobaboba(12 letters)|4000
